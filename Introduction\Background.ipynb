    "A car accident occurs whenever a car or vehicle collides with another car, obstruction or other stationary objects like tree, pole an soon. Car accident often result in injury, disability, death, and property damage as well as financial costs to both society and the individuals involved.\n",

    "A car accident severity is the monetary value of the loss caused by a car accident. it is useful in determining the premiums for a car accident."

    "When it comes to car accident, a number of factors contribute to the risk of collisions, including vehicle design, speed of operation, road design, road environment, driving skills, impairment due to alcohol or drugs, and behavior, notably distracted driving, speeding and street racing.\n",

    "In 2013, 54 million people worldwide sustained injuries from traffic collisions.[2] This resulted in 1.4 million deaths in 2013, up from 1.1 million deaths in 1990.[3] About 68,000 of these occurred in children less than five years old.[3] Almost all high-income countries have decreasing death rates, while the majority of low-income countries have increasing death rates due to traffic collisions. Middle-income countries have the highest rate with 20 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, accounting for 80% of all road fatalities with 52% of all vehicles. While the death rate in Africa is the highest (24.1 per 100,000 inhabitants), the lowest rate is to be found in Europe (10.3 per 100,000 inhabitants)\n",

    "Historically, in the United States, the use of terms other than \"accidents\" had been criticized for holding back safety improvements, based on the idea that a culture of blame may discourage the involved parties from fully disclosing the facts, and thus frustrate attempts to address the real root causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1985 study by K. Rumar, using British and American crash reports as data, suggested 57% of crashes were due solely to driver factors, 27% to combined roadway and driver factors, 6% to combined vehicle and driver factors, 3% solely to roadway factors, 3% to combined roadway, driver, and vehicle factors, 2% solely to vehicle factors, and 1% to combined roadway and vehicle factors.[16] Reducing the severity of injury in crashes is more important than reducing incidence and ranking incidence by broad categories of causes is misleading regarding severe injury reduction. Vehicle and road modifications are generally more effective than behavioral change efforts with the exception of certain laws such as required use of seat belts, motorcycle helmets, and graduated licensing of teenagers"
